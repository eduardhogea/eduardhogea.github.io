excerpt: "In this research project, I undertake a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of the OASIS MRI/Alzheimer’s dataset, an extensive collection of data from 150 subjects aged 60 to 96, including 373 imaging sessions. The dataset encompasses multiple T1-weighted MRI scans for each subject, spanning various visits, and includes variables such as demographics, clinical information, and derived anatomic volumes. The study’s core objective is to analyze the progression of dementia, with a particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease. Key indicators such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) are used to evaluate cognitive impairment and dementia severity. The analysis made in such a way to explore correlations between dementia progression and factors like age, education, socioeconomic status, and brain volume metrics. A pivotal aspect of this research is the comparison between two statistical methodologies: the Random Coefficients Model and the Mean Response Model. Employing Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Ordinal Logistic Regression, these models are chosen for their aptness in handling the longitudinal and categorical nature of the data. The research methodology includes careful handling of missing values, scaling of continuous predictors, and computation of correlation matrices. This study aims to elucidate patterns in dementia progression, with a focus on the efficacy of each model in interpreting the dynamic changes over time in a longitudinal dataset. The results section presents detailed findings, highlighting the comparative performance of the two models in capturing the complexities of Alzheimer's disease progression. The Random Coefficients model outperforms the Mean Response one, considering the evaluation metrics used."
