excerpt: "The purpose of this paper is to present a detailed investigation of the advantages of employing GraphLIME (Local Interpretable Model Explanations for Graph Neural Networks) for the trustworthy prediction of diabetes mellitus. Our pursuit involves identifying the strengths of GraphLIME combined with the attention-mechanism over the standard coupling of deep learning neural networks with the original LIME method. The system build this way, provided us a proficient method for extracting the most relevant features and applying the attention mechanism exclusively to those features. We have closely monitored the performance metrics of the two approaches and conducted a comparative analysis. Leveraging attention mechanisms, we have achieved an accuracy of 92.6% for the addressed problem. The model's performance is meticulously demonstrated throughout the study, and the results are furthermore evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. By implementing this technique on a dataset of 768 patients diagnosed with or without diabetes mellitus, we have successfully boosted the model's performance by over 18%."
