excerpt: "We introduce in this paper a neuro-symbolic predictive model based on Logic Tensor Networks, capable of discriminating and at the same time of explaining the bad connections, called alerts or attacks, and the normal connections. The proposed classifier incorporates both the ability of deep neural networks to improve on their own through learning from experience and the interpretability of the results provided by the symbolic artificial intelligence approach. Compared to other existing solutions, we advance in the discovery of potential security breaches from a cognitive perspective. By introducing the reasoning in the model, our aim is to further reduce the human staff needed to deal with the cyber-threat hunting problem. To justify the need for shifting towards hybrid systems for this task, the design, the implementation, and the comparison of the dense neural network and the neuro-symbolic model is performed in detail. While in terms of standard accuracy, both models demonstrated similar precision, we further introduced for our model the concept of interactive accuracy as a way of querying the model results at any time coupled with deductive reasoning over data. By applying our model on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, we reached an accuracy of 0.95, with levels of satisfiability around 0.85. Other advantages such as overfitting mitigation and scalability issues are also presented."
